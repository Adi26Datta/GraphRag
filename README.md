**GraphRAG**

GraphRAG is a Python-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach that uses graph databases for storing and retrieving contextual knowledge. Instead of relying solely on vector similarity, it leverages the relationships between entities to deliver more precise, explainable, and interconnected results.
